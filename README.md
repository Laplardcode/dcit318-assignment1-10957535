README for C# Console Applications: Grade Calculator, Ticket Price Calculator, and Triangle Type Identifier

Overview

This repository contains three C# console applications: Grade Calculator, Ticket Price Calculator, and Triangle Type Identifier. These applications are designed to perform specific tasks as described below.

Applications

1. Grade Calculator

The Grade Calculator application prompts the user to enter a numerical grade between 0 and 100. Based on the grade entered, it displays the corresponding letter grade using the following scale:

90 and above: A
80-89: B
70-79: C
60-69: D
Below 60: F

2. Ticket Price Calculator

The Ticket Price Calculator application calculates the ticket price for a movie theater. The standard ticket price is GHC10. However, if a customer is a senior citizen (age 65 and above) or a child (age 12 and below), they receive a discounted price of GHC7. The user is prompted to enter their age and the ticket price is calculated based on the age entered.

3. Triangle Type Identifier

The Triangle Type Identifier application prompts the user to enter three sides of a triangle. Based on the lengths of the sides entered, it determines and displays the type of the triangle. The possible types are:

Equilateral: All three sides are equal.
Isosceles: Two sides are equal.
Scalene: No sides are equal.
